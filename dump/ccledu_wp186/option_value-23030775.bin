<p>The plugin didn't work on one of two servers  unsurprisingly, the one with lower specs. The progress was either stuck at 17% or at 0%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It worked like a charm after migrating to a different server (using a different plugin), the difference being mainly much higher <em>memory_limit</em> and <em>post_max_size</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One star removed because the plugin was stuck instead of informing the user of suboptimal specs, while attempts to stop the script didn't work consistently. Once these two issues are addressed, I'll up the rating to 5 stars, because otherwise the plugin is simply brilliant  when it works.</p>

<p>I have the pro version of the plugin and it worked well, until it got stuck at 17%... permanently. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the plugin, removing all tables from my database in between installs, but that did not help with the issue. The help documents and state that PHP INI memory must be at least 256MB, but mine is 1024MB, so memory should not be an issue! I've spent as much time troubleshooting this as I'm willing. Backups are not an area in which I am willing to deal with unnecessary hassles or risks. Oh well!</p>

<ol>
<li>IndexNow: is used to inform Microsoft Bing about the latest content changes on a user’s website. The plugin sends a list of updated URLs along with the API key generated when the user saved the Instant Indexing settings. It also includes the site’s URL and the URL of the key location, allowing Bing to verify the website’s identity.<a href="https://www.indexnow.org/terms" rel="nofollow ugc">Terms and Condition</a> | <a href="https://www.indexnow.org" rel="nofollow ugc">IndexNow.org</a></li>
<li>Google Instant Index: Is a service used to notify Google when a post is created, updated, or deleted. SiteSEO utilizes this service to inform Google by sending the updated post’s URL, its state (“UPDATE” or “DELETE”), and an access token obtained via Google OAuth. <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/site-terms" rel="nofollow ugc">Terms and Conditions</a> | <a href="https://developers.google.com" rel="nofollow ugc">Google Search Central</a></li>
<li>Google OAuth: When using Google Instant Indexing SiteSEO need to verify with Google the keys the users has set to access Google’s services. So SiteSEO sends the key users has provided in the SiteSEO settings to Google to verify the user is authorized to use those keys for Instant Indexing. <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/site-terms" rel="nofollow ugc">Terms and Conditions</a> | <a href="https://developers.google.com" rel="nofollow ugc">Google Search Central</a></li>
